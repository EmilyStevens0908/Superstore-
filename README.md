# Superstore-
Superstore project (Tripleten project)

Tasks of the project

Part 1: Profits & losses

First, we'll try to identify the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore.

	Which are the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers? 
	Which products should the superstore stop selling? 
	Which product subcategories should the store focus on and which should they stop selling? 

 Part 2: Advertising

	Identify the 3 best combinations of states and month of the year to advertise in. 

 Part 3: Returned items

	Made the Returned field into a calculated field where the null values are 0 and the Yes values are 1.
	Used this new field to make a visualization for each of the following questions: 1. Which products have the highest return rate? 2. Which customers have the highest return rate?
	Made a visualization of the average profit against the average return rate on a dimension of your choice (state, shipping mode, product type, etc.). Presented a visual argument why the superstore should do away with or keep doing business on the basis of this dimension.
